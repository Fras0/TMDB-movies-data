# TMDB-movies-data
I wrote a code in jupyter notebook to analyse a data about movies from 1960 to 2015 and it's different features, I could answer 3 questions about this data: 1- Which genres are most popular from year to year? 2- What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues? 3- What are the movies with highest revenues in each genre ?
